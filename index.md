# Modding The Final Earth 2 - Unofficial Documentation

This is an unofficial modding guide put together to provide more documentation on the game's code, as well as some more tutorials not present on the [official modding guide](https://florianvanstrien.nl/TheFinalEarth2/modding.php). It is in no way complete, and any help would be greatly appreciated! If you would like to contribute, fork the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tfe2-modding/tfe2-modding.github.io) for this website and make a pull request, or simply create an issue or discussion page on the repository. To talk to other modders, check out their creations, ask for help, and show off what you are working on, you're welcome to join the official [Florian's Games Discord server](https://discord.gg/r4H25JM) and check out the #modding channel!

The goal is to eventually have tutorials and documentation alike, however right now all this page has is some very rough documentation.

- If you are looking for a specific data file, ckeck the [Data Files](DataFiles/).
- Having an issue or another question? Check the [FAQ](FAQ.html).
- Need a specific sprite from the game? You can extract it via the sprite browser in the [Tools](Tools/).
- Learning to mod? Check out the [Tutorials](Tutorials/) and the [official modding guide](https://florianvanstrien.nl/TheFinalEarth2/modding.php).
- There is also a page full of [Proposed Features](ProposedFeatures.html).

If you are looking to contribute to this site, there is a [TODO list](TODO.html) of things I would like to eventually be added, but if you think of something else to add go ahead!
